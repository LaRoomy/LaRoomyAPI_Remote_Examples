## Use the [LaRoomy App](https://www.laroomy.com/) to enter network credentials on your Portenta H7

When programming an Arduino Portenta H7 to log into a wifi network, there is often the problem that the device has no interface to enter the network credentials. Ok, the credentials could be hardcoded, but what if the wifi password or ssid has changed. Or what if the device must be moved between networks. This is where the [LaRoomy API](https://api.laroomy.com/) comes into play. With the LaRoomy API and the LaRoomy App, an minimum effort solution exists - Use it to add a Bluetooth interface quickly.
