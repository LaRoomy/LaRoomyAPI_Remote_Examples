## Simple Example

The simple example demonstrates the basic usage of the [LaRoomy Api](https://api.laroomy.com).
This is a little starter example to get an overview on the implementation. Two types of simple device properties are used, buttons and switches.

### What the program does

> First button
If the first button is pressed, the respective event will be raised in the [LaRoomy Callback Interface](https://api.laroomy.com/p/laroomy-app-callback.html).
In this example the event is used to update the property.
> Second button
The second button does nothing, only a message will be reported through the serial monitor.

> Switches
Every switch is used to control a LED.
