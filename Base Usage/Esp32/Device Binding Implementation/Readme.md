# Device Binding Implementation

This example shows how a external processing of the device binding could be achieved.

## Hardware
Three LEDs are used in this example. One to indicate the connection status. 
The remaining LEDs can be toggled by the two button properties. 
The schematic shows the common test circuit - not all elements are used.
